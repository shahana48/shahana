### Project Documentation
For Software:
This project is a web-based interactive application that combines riddles with fortune cookie mechanics.
When a user clicks the fortune cookie, a random riddle is displayed in a letter-style aesthetic. Based on the user‚Äôs answer:
Correct answer: The user receives a positive fortune.
Incorrect answer: The user receives a humorous or sarcastic reply.

The system is entirely front-end based, requiring no backend server. It is implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
